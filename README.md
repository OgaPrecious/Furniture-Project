# Furniture-Sales-Project
## 🪑 Furniture Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)
## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes furniture sales performance across the U.S. using Microsoft Excel.
The goal was to track sales, profit, quantity trends, regional distribution, and shipping insights in order to support data-driven decision-making.

I designed an interactive Excel dashboard that brings together KPIs, charts, and slicers for easy exploration of sales performance.

## 📊 Key Insights

### Sales Performance:

Total Sales: $742K (+8% YoY)

Total Profit: $18.5K (-57% YoY) ⚠️

Quantity Sold: 8K units (+11% YoY)

Strong growth in sales/quantity but profitability declined sharply, likely due to pricing/discounts.

Sales Trend:

Peak month: December ($121.8K)

Strong sales also in June and September → seasonal shopping behavior.

Regional Insights:

Top city: New York City ($75.7K)

Other strong performers: San Francisco, Seattle, Philadelphia

State-level sales range from as low as $64 to as high as $156.1K.

Shipping Insights:

Most popular shipping modes: Standard Class & Second Class

Majority of orders (28%) delivered in 4 days

Shipping operations are fairly efficient (2–5 days for most orders).
